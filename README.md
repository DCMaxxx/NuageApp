NuageApp
========

What is it ?
--------
Let's start with [CloudApp](http://cl.ly "CloudApp's home page").
CloudApp is a simple service that allows you to upload all kind of files, images, music, videos, bookmarks... You can share the link, manage your file in the Mac application or in your browser, access your files anywhere...

NuageApp is a fully featured CloudApp iPhone client, you can do everything the web-app can do.
Here are its main features :
+ Create an account
+ Access your account, and modify your settings (email address, password, custom domain, default upload setting)
+ Browse all your drops, rename them, change their privacy, view their stats, trash them
+ Browse your trash, restore drops
+ Open pictures, musics, videos, texts, bookmarks without leaving the application
+ Open any other file in your other iOS apps that can handle it
+ Bookmark a link
+ Drop a picture

Why is it cool ?
--------
If you've ever used CloudApp Mac's client, you've probably felt in love with the screenshot autoupload feature.
When you take a screenshot, it automatically gets uploaded and the link copied to your clipboard.  
Don't need to upload it on a web page, wait thirty second until the picture gets uploaded, gets tons of ads to get to your link anymore. Productivity enhanced over nine thousand.

And that's what I wanted to brought to the iPhone with NuageApp.
Unfortunately, due to iOS restrictions, it's impossible to detect when a screenshot is taken on your device. Anyway, to workaround this issue, NuageApp offers the possibility to auto-upload the last taken picture from your camera roll when you open the application.

And of course, as in the Mac's application, you don't need to copy the link by yourself. When a picture is uploaded, or a link bookmarked, it is instantly copied to your clipboard.
But... what if you want to get the link on your Mac ? You could always send it by mail, message, but it would be a waste of time. And that's why NuageApp also has a tiny Mac application that will instantly display a notification and copy the link to the clipboard when you upload a file from your iPhone, as long as your iPhone and your Mac are on the same network.

And here it is, CloudApp's best feature, ported to iOS.
